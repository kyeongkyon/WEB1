 <p>The three major sectors of the space industry are: satellite manufacturing, support ground equipment manufacturing, and the launch industry. The satellite manufacturing sector is composed of satellite and their subsystems manufacturers. 
 The ground equipment sector is composed of manufacturing items like <a href="https://www.apmterminals.com/en/mobile" target="_blank" title="mobile terminal description"> mobile terminals</a>, gateways, control stations, VSATs, direct broadcast satellite dishes, and other specialized equipment. <br>The launch sector is composed of launch services, vehicle manufacturing and subsystem manufacturing.[3] 
 <p><p style="margin-top:40px;">With regards to the worldwide satellite industry revenues, in the period 2002 to 2005 those remained at the 35–36 billion USD level.s[3] In that, majority of revenue was generated by the ground equipment sector, with the least amount by the launch sector.[7] Space-related services are estimated at about US$100 billion.
 [8] The industry and related sectors employ about 120,000 people in the OECD countries,[8] while the space industry of Russia employs around 250,000 people.[9] Capital stocks estimated the worth of 937 satellites in Earth's orbit in 2005 at around 170 to US$230 billion.[8] In 2005, OECD countries budgeted around US$45 billion 
 for space-related activities; income from space-derived products and services has been estimated at US$110–120 billion in 2006 (worldwide).[10] </p>
